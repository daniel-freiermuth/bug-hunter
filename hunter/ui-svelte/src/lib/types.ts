// API wire types, generated from the hunter-rs structs by ts-rs into
// ./generated/ (`just bindings` in hunter-rs/). Never declare a shape here:
// derive `TS` on the Rust type instead. This file only re-exports.
//
// Generated types say what the daemon sends, not what arrives: `api<T>()`
// casts without looking, so the runtime guard is still `validate.ts`.
