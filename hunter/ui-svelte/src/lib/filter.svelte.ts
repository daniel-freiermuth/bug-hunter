/**
 * One filter dimension of the filter bar (repo, type, class, severity,
 * status), as a two-state value.
 *
 * The whole semantics is this: a dimension is either "all", meaning
 * everything including options nobody has seen yet, or "only", meaning
 * exactly the listed values and nothing else. That second state is what
 * makes the model work — it is a statement about the future as well as
 * the present, so an option that turns up later is covered by it.
 *
 * The previous model could not express that. It kept the selected values
 * plus a parallel set of every option ever seen, and auto-selected each
 * option the first time it appeared, so that new data could not silently
 * hide itself. But "the user switched this dimension off" was not
 * representable, so a newly arriving option had nothing to inherit and
 * took the default: after deselecting All, the next poll that brought a
 * new option selected it, the All box went indeterminate on its own, and
 * a finding the user had filtered out appeared in the list.
 *
 * Here "deselect All" is `only` with no values, and it stays that way
 * because a new option is not in the set. Nothing decays.
 *
 * Two properties worth stating, because they are the reason for the
 * shape rather than accidents of it:
 *
 * - In `all`, new options are visible immediately. This is the guarantee
 *   the old auto-select existed to provide, and it survives: no data can
 *   appear without being shown unless the user has said otherwise.
 * - In `only`, the values are remembered even when they are absent from
 *   the current options. A repo whose findings are all triaged still
 *   counts as chosen when it comes back, so the dimension does not
 *   quietly change meaning while the data moves underneath it.
 *
 * Every predicate takes the currently offered `options` rather than
 * caching them: which options exist is the caller's business and changes
 * on every poll, while what the user asked for is this object's business
 * and changes only when they act.
