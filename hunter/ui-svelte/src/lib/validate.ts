// Structural checks for the polled API responses.
//
// `api<T>()` casts whatever JSON came back to `T` without looking at it, so
// the type parameter is a claim about the server, not a fact about the
// bytes. The claim holds for the real daemon; it does not hold for the
// things that sit between the two in practice — a proxy error page served
// as 200 with a JSON content type, a captive portal, a truncated body, or
// a daemon mid-rollback answering an older schema.
//
// The previous guard only checked top-level categories: object vs array.
// `{}` is an object, so an empty body passed as a `Summary` and was written
// into the store, and `StatusPage` then read `summary.activity_status.kind`
// off `undefined`.
//
// These validators deliberately check only what the UI actually
// dereferences without a `?.`, which is why they are not a schema mirror:
// a field the components already treat as optional does not need to be
// present for the dashboard to render, and requiring it would turn a
// harmless server addition into a blank page. The rule for adding to this
// file is the same rule that put each line in it — something renders it
// unconditionally, and a `{#each}` key is rendered unconditionally even
// when nothing dereferences it.
