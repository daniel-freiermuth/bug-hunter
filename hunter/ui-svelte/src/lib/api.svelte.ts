 * connection and then answers nothing wedges the gate shut for good, with
 * `error` still null — App.svelte then shows frozen data with no staleness
 * banner, forever. The rejection here is what reopens the gate and lights
 * the banner.
 *
 * 20s = 4 poll periods. The floor is generosity: the slowest read is
 * /api/findings, ~3.2MB for the 689 findings held today, served in ~85ms
 * on loopback, and a refresh that merely outlasts a few ticks (daemon
 * mid-cycle, five requests queued behind the browser's per-origin
 * connection limit) must still be allowed to land — the store promises
 * exactly that. The ceiling is the cost of being wrong: this bound plus
 * one poll period is how long the dashboard can present stale data as
 * live, so ~25s worst case.
 *
 * Deadline built from the global timer rather than `AbortSignal.timeout`,
 * which the runtime does support: that one runs on an internal clock
 * nothing can advance, so the bound would be unobservable from the same
 * clock that drives POLL_MS.

 * cancel the server-side work, it only discards the answer, leaving the
