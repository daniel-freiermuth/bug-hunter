You are following up on a MODERNIZATION proposal in the worktree at {{WORKTREE}} (repo
{{REPO_NAME}}, branch {{BRANCH}} — already checked out for you). Work only inside this
worktree. NEVER push. NEVER run project-wide formatters.

This playbook is deliberately NOT apply_improvement.md's contract. A human explicitly queued
this proposal knowing it may require a big, breaking, or multi-file change — that is expected
here, not a reason to decline.

# Protocol

## 1. Re-verify before doing anything

The hunt-time claims (deprecation, staleness, EOL, "X is mature now") may be stale by the time
this runs — training data and even a recent hunt pass can be wrong. Re-check with real
commands or sources: registry/repo activity, actual deprecation notices, actual published EOL
dates. If re-verification shows the premise no longer holds (the library got a new maintainer,
the format never gained real adoption, the EOL date moved), STOP: write DECLINED.md saying so,
with the re-verification evidence.

## 2. Decide the right deliverable for THIS proposal's actual scope

There is no single correct shape here — pick the one that is honest about how far a single
pass can responsibly go, and what is still a judgment call for a human:

### (a) Migration plan only — the default for anything genuinely large
If a full migration cannot be responsibly attempted in one pass (spans many files, needs a
design decision, has unclear rollback), do NOT attempt the code change. Instead, commit ONLY
a plan document under `docs/` named after the finding's fingerprint or topic (e.g.
`docs/MODERNIZATION-<topic-slug>.md`):
- Current state, target state, concrete migration steps in order, what breaks and for whom,
  an effort estimate, and your recommendation
- This MUST be a real commit (a shipped PR always needs at least one) — do not leave it
  uncommitted and only describe it in the PR body
- Prefix the PR title with `[RFC]` so it is unambiguous this needs a decision, not a merge

### (b) Proof of concept / spike — when a meaningful chunk IS tractable
If you can demonstrate the migration working end-to-end for a representative slice (even if
incomplete), do that: commit the working spike, and be explicit in the PR description about
exactly what is NOT done yet. Breaking existing behavior in the spike is fine as long as it is
disclosed, not discovered later.

### (c) Full migration — only when genuinely tractable in scope and you have high confidence
Same commit-per-step, test-as-you-go discipline as any other fix. Breaking changes are allowed
here — call them out explicitly in the PR description; do not downplay them.

### CI/CD gaps specifically: usually (c), not (a)

A `ci-cd-gap` finding is a different shape from a code migration -- adding or wiring up a
workflow file is normally additive and isolated from application code, not a multi-file
rewrite with unclear rollback. Default to (c) full implementation for wiring up
lint/test/build gates; do NOT drop to an RFC plan document just because "modernization
findings often do." The exceptions:
- **Release/publish automation is the higher-risk part of this class** — it touches external
  registries, app stores, or secrets you don't have and shouldn't invent. For that piece
  specifically, prefer (a) a plan document (what secrets/environment a human needs to
  provision) or (b) a dry-run-only spike (build the release artifact, do not attempt to
  actually publish it) — never fabricate credentials or assume a secret already exists.
- Mirror the project's OWN existing tooling. Before writing a single line of workflow YAML,
  find how this repo already builds/tests/lints/releases by hand (Makefile, justfile,
  `package.json` scripts, README/CONTRIBUTING instructions) and wire up exactly those
  commands — do not introduce a generic template pipeline with commands the project doesn't
  actually use.
- **Verify every command locally before it goes in the workflow file.** Run the exact
  lint/test/build/release-dry-run commands you're about to add, in this worktree, right now,
  and quote the results. A new workflow file typically will not execute until this PR is
  merged (GitHub/GitLab do not run brand-new pipeline definitions against the PR that adds
  them the same way they run existing ones) — your local run is the only verification
  evidence that will exist before merge, so it is not optional.

Whichever you pick, COMMIT PER STEP: you may be killed at any moment, and committed work
survives while anything only in your head does not. Every path — including (a) — ends with at
least one commit; a PR needs a diff to open.

## 3. Verify whatever you actually changed

If you changed code: run the affected tests. If you only wrote a plan: there is nothing to
run, but every factual claim the plan relies on must still be the re-verified evidence from
step 1, not the original hunt-time claim restated.

# Deliverables

- **Commits on {{BRANCH}}** — at least one in every path, even (a) (the plan document itself)
- **PR-DESCRIPTION.md** at the worktree root, NOT COMMITTED (becomes the PR body): which of
  (a) / (b) / (c) you chose and why, the plan or the verification results, and — critically —
  exactly what a human still needs to decide
- If you chose (a), start the PR-DESCRIPTION.md title line with `[RFC]` so draft-PR review
  expectations are set correctly from the subject line alone

OR if re-verification showed the premise no longer holds:

- **DECLINED.md**: what you re-verified and why it is no longer worth pursuing, with the
  verification command/output backing the claim

# What this is not

Not a license to guess. Every "unmaintained" / "deprecated" / "EOL" / "now mature" claim
inherited from the finding gets re-verified here too — the hunt could be stale by the time
this runs, and a wrong migration recommendation is worse than no recommendation.
