You are hunting for MECHANICAL REFACTORING OPPORTUNITIES in the repository at {{REPO_PATH}} ({{REPO_NAME}}).
Read-only investigation: do NOT modify the repo, do NOT run formatters.
Output is candidate refactorings only — CONSERVATIVE, SAFE, MECHANICAL changes.

Focus on safe, mechanical improvements with LOW RISK:

## What Counts as a Refactor Opportunity

### Code Duplication (smell: duplication)
- **Exact duplicates**: 5+ identical lines repeated 2+ times
- **Near duplicates**: Same logic with minor variations (parameter differences)
- **Refactor**: Extract to shared function/method

### Dead Code (smell: dead-code)
- **Unreachable code**: Branches that can never execute
- **Unused exports**: Functions/classes exported but never imported
- **Commented-out code**: Large blocks of old code left in comments
- **Refactor**: Remove safely

### Complexity (smell: complexity)
- **Long functions**: 100+ lines, multiple responsibilities
- **Deep nesting**: 4+ levels of indentation
- **High cyclomatic complexity**: 15+ branches
- **Refactor**: Extract subfunctions, simplify conditionals

### Outdated Patterns (smell: outdated-pattern)
- **Deprecated APIs**: Using old stdlib/library methods with modern replacements
- **Callback hell**: Nested callbacks where async/await available
- **Manual loops**: for-loops doing map/filter/reduce operations
- **Refactor**: Modernize to current idioms

### Magic Numbers/Strings (smell: magic-values)
- **Unnamed constants**: Repeated literals (except 0, 1, "", true, false)
- **Refactor**: Extract to named constants

NOT refactors: Style preferences, subjective improvements, architectural changes, introducing new abstractions.

# Known non-candidates (suppression corpus — do NOT re-file these or variants)
{{SUPPRESSIONS}}

# Already tracked (open refactorings — file only if yours is genuinely NOVEL)
Refactors move code, so compare by mechanism, not by file/line location.
{{KNOWN_REFACTORS}}

# Output contract — INCREMENTAL, you may be killed at any moment
Create {{OUT_PATH}} containing `[]` as your VERY FIRST action. After EACH
verified opportunity, rewrite the complete file with everything confirmed so far
— committed refactorings survive a kill, anything only in your head does not.

  "detail": "what's wrong, why refactor, with file:line evidence",
  "suggested_refactor": "concrete refactor approach (e.g., 'extract duplicate to shared util', 'remove unreachable else branch')"
}
```

Severity guide:
- **high**: Dead code cluttering codebase, severe duplication (10+ instances), extreme complexity (20+ cyclomatic)
- **medium**: Moderate duplication (3-5 instances), high complexity (10-15), outdated patterns with clear migration
- **low**: Minor duplication (2 instances), mild complexity, magic values

Confidence guide:
- **0.9+**: Dead code (provably unused), exact duplication
- **0.7-0.9**: Near duplication, outdated pattern with clear replacement
- **0.5-0.7**: Complexity-based, subjective improvement value
- **<0.5**: Marginal cases, prefer keeping as-is

Every refactoring MUST include file:line evidence and concrete suggestion. Focus on HIGH-VALUE, LOW-RISK changes. Then stop.
