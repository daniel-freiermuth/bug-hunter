//! `run_worker` end to end — metering, the unmetered verdict, output drain.
//!
//! `harness_test.rs` covers the pieces (`ledger_usage`, `kill_tree`) in
//! isolation. Nothing covered the function that
//! wires them together, which is where the accounting invariant lives:
//!
//! > a run whose token spend could not be measured must never be recorded
//! > as costing zero.
//!
//! `tokens_new = 0` means "unknown", never "free". A review round found
//! `run_worker` dropping a ledger-less worker through as a clean success:
//! the budget then under-counts the window *and* the false zero drags the
//! `anticipated_tokens` percentiles down, so the next job is sized against
//! a spend that never happened. `killed_reason` is the flag that stops it —
//! `scheduler::job_state` maps `Some(_)` to `JobState::Killed`, and only
//! `None` + exit 0 to `JobState::Done`.
//!
//! The seam: `cfg.omp_bin` is looked up on `PATH` (`FakeBins`). Session
//! directories need no sandboxing — the caller hands `run_worker` a
//! workspace under a scratch directory, never the operator's
//! `~/.omp/agent/sessions`. `$OMP_HOME` is still redirected so that a
//! worker which ignores `--session-dir` writes into the scratch tree
//! instead of the developer's real one.
