//! Rotation fairness: what an unsuccessful rotation-scan attempt does to
//! `last_<kind>_at`.
//!
//! `run_cycle_inner` bumps that timestamp when a rotation scan's attempt
//! — hunt or analysis — did not succeed, so a scan that fails forever
//! stops being the perpetual "oldest" pick and everything else gets a
//! turn. The condition that decides "ran to an end" is
//! `attempt_ended`, and the cases below are its edges: a kill, a
//! failure and a partly invalid ingest are failed turns and must bump, a
//! suspension is a pause and must not.
//!
//! Driven through `run_cycle` rather than the executor, because the bump
//! lives in the cycle and not in the runners — calling an executor
//! directly would assert on nothing at all.
