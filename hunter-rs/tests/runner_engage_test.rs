#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used, clippy::panic)]
//! `run_engage` — withdrawal, push/reply, retry and guard paths — and
//! what a PR closing does to its finding.
//!
//! This is the runner layer, which had no tests until a review found a P1
//! here: `close_pr` was changed to propagate a failed withdrawal comment,
//! but the caller still recorded the withdrawal as complete, leaving the
//! PR open on the forge, closed in the database, and the finding rejected
//! — and `sync_prs` only revisits `pr_open` findings, so nothing would
//! ever reconcile it.
//!
//! A closed PR, whether a worker withdrew it or a human closed it, leaves
//! its finding `closed` for the harvest to classify, never `rejected`:
//! 15 of the first 16 closures were engage withdrawals, 14 of them
//! "superseded/obsolete", and rejecting those suppressed valid findings.
//!
//! Worth reading as a template for the other runners: `support` gives you
//! a git repo with a real origin, a scripted `gh`, and a backend that
//! stages whatever the worker would have left in the worktree.
